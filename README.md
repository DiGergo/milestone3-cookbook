# Coockbook

This website was created to help people store they recipes in one place. It's easy to use, you can add, update, remove and read other peoples recipes.
I created this website as a showcase of the skills learned through the Fullstack Software Developer Course by Code Institute.

## UX 

The site is easy to use, fully responsive and allows users to create, update, read, and delete recipes from the webpage.
It's an easy way to store your recipes all in one place.

### Research

To create an easily understandable website I looked up a few sites with the similar topic and built my page in the similar way.

## Features

### Functionality

* The user can browse from the recipes database, they can Add / Remove / Update recipes. The site is connected to MongoDB.
* The site is responsive and fully scalable.
* With the search bar the user can easily find a recipe in the database

### Features left to implement

* User login and register. Now anyone can add/delete from the recipes which is a bit dangerous :) .
* Add favourite buttons to the recipes, so when the user returns to the site can search by favourites.
*
